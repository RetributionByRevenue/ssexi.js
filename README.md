**Server-Sent Events + Forms for Hypermedia Apps**

`ssexi.js` is a lightweight JavaScript library inspired by `fixi.js` for declarative **live updates** and **form submissions** via **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**.
It‚Äôs intentionally simple, limited in scope, and designed for small web apps with minimal JavaScript.
No frameworks. No build tools. Just drop it in and go.

## Philosophy

SSEXI.js is built on the principle that web applications should be simple, declarative, and follow the hypermedia approach. Instead of complex JavaScript frameworks, it uses inline HTML attributes to define behavior, making web applications more readable and maintainable.

### Core Principles

1. **Single Persistent Connection**: Keep one GET connection open using `sx-connect` on the body element
2. **Form-Based Interactions**: Use standard HTML forms with `sx-post` for user interactions
3. **Declarative Attributes**: Define behavior through HTML attributes, not JavaScript
4. **Real-time Reactivity**: Superior to traditional AJAX through persistent SSE connections
5. **Hypermedia Compliance**: HTML-first approach with minimal JavaScript interference

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Include the script

```html
<script src="ssexi.js"></script>
```

---

## üß¨ Mark Your HTML

Apply declarative attributes **directly on `<body>`**:

```html
<body sx-connect="/events/news">
  <div id="news-feed"></div>
</body>
```

---

## ‚úâÔ∏è Forms via `[sx-post]`

```html
<form sx-post="/api/submit" sx-swap="none">
  <input name="email" />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

* Form data is POSTed to the given endpoint.
* Handled via `FormData` with fetch.

---

## üì° Server Sends Updates Like

Send newline-delimited JSON SSE messages like this:

```
data: {"html": {"news-feed": "<div id='news-feed'><p>Latest News!</p></div>"}}
data: {"js": {"exec": "console.log('News updated!')"}}
data { "js": { "counterValue": 5 } }
```

Each `data:` line should contain **one JSON object**. Supported keys:

* `"html"`: DOM updates keyed by `id`
* `"js.exec"`: JavaScript to eval
* `"js.someVar"`: Sets `window.someVar`(window scope and hydrate web components)

## ‚úÖ Features

* Auto-connects to SSE endpoints with `[sx-connect]`
* Auto-submits forms with `[sx-post]`
* Updates parts of the DOM based on simple JSON from the server
* Handles JavaScript execution and variable injection
* Reconnects SSE automatically if disconnected
* Observes new DOM nodes and initializes them automatically

---

## üîÅ Reconnection Logic

If the connection drops, `ssexi.js` will attempt to reconnect after 5 seconds, as long as the element is still present in the DOM.

---

## üîß Manual API

```js
ssexi.process(element);     // Manually process new elements
ssexi.connections;          // Map of open EventSource connections
ssexi.version;              // "1.0.0"
```

---

## üì¶ Compatibility

* Works in all modern browsers that support EventSource
* No external dependencies
